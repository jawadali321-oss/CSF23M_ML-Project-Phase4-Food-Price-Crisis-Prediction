## What This Phase Covers

Phase 3 is about feature engineering. The goal was to find which features matter, build new ones, and check if they improve the model.

---

## Dataset

- **Rows:** 4434
- **Target column:** `crisis_next_3m` (binary — will there be a food crisis in the next 3 months)
- **Input:** Preprocessed CSV from Phase 2

---

## Steps Done

### 1. Feature Importance — 5 Methods

Ran 5 different methods to understand which features are actually useful:

- **Random Forest** — FCAI and Inflation came out on top
- **Gradient Boosting** — FCAI dominated heavily (0.79 importance score)
- **Extra Trees** — More balanced, lag features ranked higher here
- **SHAP** — Most reliable method; confirmed FCAI and Inflation as top 2
- **Permutation Importance** — Tested by shuffling features and measuring AUC drop
- **LIME** — Used for one sample to explain a single prediction locally

Combined all 5 into a rank aggregation table to get a final consensus ranking.

**Top features across all methods:** `FCAI`, `Inflation`, `rolling_avg_3m`, `lag_2`

### 2. New Features Created (10 total)

| Feature | Why |
|---|---|
| `inflation_sq` | Inflation squared — captures non-linear price acceleration |
| `price_spread` | High minus Low — measures daily market instability |
| `close_open_ratio` | Close / Open — shows price direction within a session |
| `inflation_volatility` | Inflation × Volatility — both being high together is worse than either alone |
| `lag_diff` | lag_1 minus lag_2 — rate of change between months |
| `price_vs_rolling` | Current price minus 3-month average — detects sudden spikes |
| `fcai_inflation` | FCAI × Inflation — combines the two strongest signals |
| `month_sin / month_cos` | Seasonal encoding — harvest and lean seasons follow a cycle |
| `inflation_vel_sq` | Velocity squared — rapid acceleration is more dangerous than steady inflation |
| `market_coverage_ratio` | Markets modeled / covered — low ratio means missing data = hidden risk |

---

### 3. LightGBM Validation (default settings)

| Model | Features | ROC-AUC |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline | 25 | 0.9957 |
| + Feature Engineering | 36 | 0.9950 |
| Pruned FE | 28 | 0.9950 |
| Pruned FE + KMeans | 29 | 0.9956 |

AUC stayed above 0.995 throughout. The baseline was already strong so the delta is small, but the new features kept performance stable after pruning.

---

### 4. Dropped Features

Bottom 20% by LightGBM importance were removed:
`number_of_markets_modeled`, `number_of_markets_covered`, `number_of_food_items`, `data_coverage_food`, `average_annualized_food_inflation`, `average_annualized_food_volatility`, `index_confidence_score`, `market_coverage_ratio`

These had near-zero importance and removing them kept AUC the same while reducing noise.

---

### 5. Standardization

Applied `StandardScaler` on the pruned feature set. Required before KMeans since it uses distance.

---

### 6. KMeans Cluster Feature

Used 4 clusters. Result was meaningful:

| Cluster | Crisis Rate |
|---|---|
| 0 | 5.1% |
| 1 | 53.7% |
| 2 | 42.0% |
| 3 | 100% |

Cluster 3 is pure crisis — every row in it had a food crisis. This cluster label was added as a new feature `vulnerability_cluster`.
